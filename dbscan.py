    Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise is a data clustering algorithm 
    proposed by Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, JÃ¶rg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996. It is a density-based 
    clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that 
    are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie 
    alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
